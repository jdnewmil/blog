Jeff Newmiller has been measuring, recording, and analyzing engineering data since 1986, and computing since 1981. While he took a detour into developing electronics and control software the aerospace industry in the early 1990s, most of his career has been focused on observing, characterizing and modeling photovoltaic power generation system performance.

These days, most of his time is spent consulting to the solar power generation industry and its investors on issues related to photovoltaic power production. The primary tools of his everyday work are R and Python.
