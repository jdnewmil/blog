      <description>I have been keeping a file of solutions to small data analysis problems I find on the internet on my computer, and thought it might be nice to be able to point people at them… which kind of leads to having a blog. You may find it dry reading if you are looking for juicy bits about my personal life though… I rarely feel the need to share in that way.</description>
